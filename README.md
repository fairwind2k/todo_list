This is my solution of exercise "Shopping list" on Andrei Neagoie's The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery Udemy course.

Tasks are:
- If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done  class on and off;
- Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button;
- When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button next to it.
